Gilad Almosnino is an internationalization expert. I'm reading his post ["Eight emojis that will create a more inclusive experience for Middle Eastern markets,"](https://www.worldreadyguides.com/post/eight-emojis-that-will-create-a-more-inclusive-experience-for-middle-eastern-markets) in which he mentions "Turkish or Arabic Coffee," which reminded me of my [last visit to Athens](https://gorelik.net/2020/01/08/athens-greece/). When, in one restaurant, I asked for a Turkish coffee, the waiter looked at me harshly and said: "It's not Turkish coffee; it's Greek coffee!"
