Stalin was a relatively short man, his height was 1.65 m. Khrushchev was even shorter, his height was 1.60. It seems that the difference wasn't enough for the official Soviet propaganda of that time. Take a look at this photo. We can clearly see that Stalin is taller than Khrushchev.

Do you notice something strange? Take a look at the windows in the background. I added horizontal and vertical guides for your convenience.

Now, look what happens when we fix the horizontal and vertical lines

Now,Â Khrushchev is still shorter than Stalin but not by that much.
