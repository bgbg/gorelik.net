I wrote about data giraffes [two weeks ago](https://gorelik.net/2020/03/18/an-interesting-solution-to-data-giraffes/). Usually, "data giraffes" are a problem and we need to work hard in order to solve it. Sometimes, they are a useful feature. Take a look at this NYT front page that shows the number of new unemployment applications in the United States over the time

And this is the [pseudochartchart](https://gorelik.net/2019/09/09/pseudochart-its-like-a-pseudocode-but-for-charts/) version of the same data
