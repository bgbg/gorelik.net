I will skip the usual "I'm thrilled and excited…". I'll just say it.  
As of today, I am the CTO of [wizer.me](http://wizer.md/), a platform for teachers and educators to create and share interactive worksheets.

On a scale of 1 to 10, how thrilled am I? 10  
On a scale of 1 to 10, how terrified am I? 10  
On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident am I that wizer.me will become the "next big thing" and the most significant chapter in my career? You won't believe me, but also 10.
