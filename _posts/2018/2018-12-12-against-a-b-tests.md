> **Traditional A/B testsing rests on a fundamentally flawed premise. Most of the time, version A will be better for some subgroups, and version B will be better for others. Choosing either A or B is _inherently_inferior to choosing a targeted mix of A _and_ B.**

The quote above is from a post by Michael Kaminsky "[Against A/B tests](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/against-ab-tests/?utm_campaign=The%20Data%20Science%20Roundup&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)". I'm still not fully convinced by Michael's thesis but it is very interesting and thought-provoking.
